# mathsoc_docs
MathSoc Policy Repo, which I am creating while I edit stuff related to the Mathematics Society so people can see what each edit means. 

## Future

This repo will not stay here, it will most likely move to GitLab with the University of Waterloo (to provide more transparency and access). It will also be broken into seperate repositories for different things. Not sure how to maintain styles yet. 

I would also like to reccomend a tool for people to use to do stuff like this, and an online one seems particularily ideal. So far I have found :
https://www.sharelatex.com
https://www.overleaf.com

Have not done a feature comparison yet.
