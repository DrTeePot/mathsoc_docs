\section*{Honourary Lifetime Membership}
The Honorary Lifetime Members of the Society are those persons who have made exceptionally significant contributions to the Society or towards its goals. Honorary Lifetime Memberships may be conferred only by a three-quarters majority vote, conducted by secret ballot, of a general meeting of the Society.

Honorary Lifetime Memberships are valid for the lifetime of the Society and cannot be revoked. Honorary Lifetime Members cannot have obligations imposed on them due to their status; if they accept a position within the Society, however, they are still obligated to fulfill the duties of that position.

\textbf{Nominees: Ian Goulden, Elizabeth McFaul, Elana Hashman, Lauren Hurley, Ty Rozak}
