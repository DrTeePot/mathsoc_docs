\section*{DDC Disbandment}
Motion to disband the Double Degree Club for multiple violations of MathSoc Club policy, as well as their own constitution, as well as the actions of their president at the budget meeting.
Details include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Not explicitly stating their affiliation with WLUSU in their constitution;
	\item Having an illegitimate membership list (needs to be updated every term, as per their constitution and MathSoc policy);
	\item Not adequately ensuring that money provided by MathSoc was only used for the benefit of MathSoc social members;
	\item Not electing their executives before the second week of term (according to their own constitution), and using MathSoc's policy of having executives elected before the end of the third week of term as an excuse for not coming to the mandatory clubs briefing; and
	\item Inappropriate behaviour by the president at the budget meeting.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{MathSoc Recognition}
To change clubs policy 6.2.1 Events to read (new text is emphasized):\\

...Vice-President, Internal and the Clubs Director shall assist clubs in filing
event forms and securing approval for events.

\emph{All promotional material for events must include MathSoc's logo.}

A social event is an event with negligible academic purpose.

\section*{Calculator Policy Committee}
Context: We had a very productive meeting with Steve Furino earlier today where we concluded that if MathSoc could present proposals for a calculator policy, or changes to the current new policy, which address the motivations for the new policy the faculty is open to considering them. This should happen.\\\\
Purpose: to investigate and recommend a Calculator Policy to the faculty. \\\\
Composition: The committee will be made up of the following members:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sean Harrap;
	\item the President to the Society; and
	\item two at-large members of the Mathematics Society. 
\end{enumerate}
Sean Harrap will convene and chair the first meeting.\\\\
Nominations for the at large seats:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Darcy Alemany, 
	\item Katherine Tu, 
	\item Lily Holmes, and 
	\item Fatema Boxwala
\end{enumerate}
