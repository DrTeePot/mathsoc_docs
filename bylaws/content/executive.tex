Society and its members.

\subsection{Incapacitation}
In the event that an Executive becomes unable to fulfill their duties, then
three voting members of Council may, with the written approval of the Dean or
his designate, declare that Executive to be incapacitated. An Executive may also
declare themselves to be incapacitated by written submission to the rest of
Council.

If an Executive, including the President, is declared incapacitated or ceases to
hold their position for any reason, a decision of the Society shall appoint an
interim replacement. If it is necessary for Council to make the appointment,
Council shall convene as soon as is practicable to do so, and the remaining
Executive, if any, shall recommend a potential appointee at that meeting. If one
voting member of Council is appointed as interim replacement for an Executive,
then for the duration of the time that they serve as interim replacement, their
original powers and duties shall be suspended and, if the replacement is
themselves an Executive, an interim replacement shall be appointed for them and
so on. For greater certainty, the duties and powers referred to in this
paragraph include those of being voting member of Council, as is inherent in
each of the Executive positions.

An Executive may resume their duties by providing written notice to Council at
least three days in advance. A notice by an Executive declaring themselves to be
incapacitated for a fixed period of time counts as notice for this purpose. At
the date specified in the notice, unless indicated otherwise by an intervening
written notice from that Executive, they resume their duties and powers. If
their interim replacement was another Executive, then that Executive resumes
their duties at the same time with no requirement of notice on their part.

\subsection{Remuneration of Executives}
As a form of compensation, each Executive will receive an honorarium of \$300 for serving in a given academic term, provided that they have been in the role for the majority of the term, are still in their role on the last day of the term. This honorarium will be awarded through a single payment payment within two weeks of the report on their performance being presented to a General Meeting. This does not preclude other non-monetary compensation. 

In the event that an Executive fails to effectively perform his or her duties, a resolution by a General Meeting of the Society may strip them of their honorarium with a two-thirds vote, provided that the meeting occurs before the payment is awarded. Debate on any such resolution will be held in secret session, without the presence of the Executive(s) in question. Furthermore, if a voting member so desires at the General Meeting, discussion of the Executive(s)' evaluation report (as presented by the Executive Evaluation Committee) will also be held in secret session, without the Executive(s) in question.
