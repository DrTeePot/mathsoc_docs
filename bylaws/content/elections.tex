    This section is fine to understand, but all sections relating to a specific
    position should be updated to be with those positions. As well, this 
    section is currently out of date with resolutions of past General Meetings.

All aspects of election procedure not defined explicitly in this document may be
set by a decision of the Society.

\subsection{General Election}
General elections shall be held in the fall term for each of the three terms 
of the subsequent year. In an election, a candidate does not need to run for 
each of the three terms for which the election is held. A single ballot shall 
be taken from each voter for all three terms in conjunction, and the results 
shall be evaluated separately for each term, but a candidate cannot win a term 
for which they are not running.

Elections shall be conducted using a preferential ballot system.

\subsection{By-elections}
In the event that one or more seats on Council or any of the executive
positions become vacant during the first two months of a term, or is left
vacant after an election, a by-election shall be held for those seats. If a
seat is vacant for a future term, then a by-election may be held before the
start of the vacant seatâ€™s term. If no by-election is held by the start of that
term, one shall be held as soon as possible after the term begins.

Representative is elected to an Executive seat, then they lose their
Representative seat.
