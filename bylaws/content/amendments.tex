%%AMENDMENTS (a)
\section{Amendments}
Amendments to this document may be made by a referendum or by a two-thirds
majority vote of Council or of a general meeting, with notice.

If an amendment is made by Council, then it can take effect immediately (or as
specified in a proviso), but it shall be subject to confirmation by a general
meeting. A general meeting may reject or confirm the amendment - if rejected
or if not confirmed by the end of the subsequent regular termly general meeting,
then the amendment is reversed and no subsequent amendment by Council of similar
substance has any effect until confirmed at a general meeting. An amendment
passed at a general meeting implictly confirms similar amendments by Council.

\subsection{Contracts}
For the Society to enter into or assent to an amendment to a contract
that binds it for a duration of more than one term, it must be explicitly
approved by the same process as an amendment to this document, except that there
is no requirement of confirmation by a general meeting.

External agreements entered into by the Society must be compliant with this
document and any relevant decisions of the Society. Additionally, unless it
terminates sooner, the Society can enter into an agreement only if it contains a
clause requiring that it be reviewed by the parties to it no less often than
once every four years.
